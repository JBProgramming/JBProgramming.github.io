Around March this year, 2018, I began growing some nastertium seeds that I had been given by a neighbour.  They were just on the windowsill and so got a lot of light and so grew  quickly.  They were growing so tall that I assumed they must be climbing plants and so planted them out, after the last frost, by the back door with a trellis made of string for them to climb up.  Since then they have grown well and they have produced quite a lot of their untidy-looking orange flowers.  Unfortunately, they have also been beset by all kinds of visitors.
